# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis
This project involves comprehensive analysis of weather data to understand trends, anomalies, and patterns in atmospheric conditions over time.
## 📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains hourly weather data with the following key features:
- **Date/Time**: Timestamp of the observation  
- **Temp (°C)**: Temperature in Celsius  
- **Dew Point Temp (°C)**: Dew point temperature  
- **Rel Hum (%)**: Relative humidity  
- **Wind Speed (km/h)**: Wind speed  
- **Visibility (km)**: Visibility distance  
- **Press (kPa)**: Atmospheric pressure  
- **Weather**: General weather condition (e.g., Snow, Rain, Clear)

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Removed or imputed missing values  
- Converted timestamp to datetime format  
- Extracted date features (Year, Month, Day, Hour, Weekday)  
- Filtered relevant columns for focused analysis  

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

- Identified frequency and distribution of weather conditions  
- Analyzed temperature trends across seasons and time of day  
- Examined relationships between humidity, visibility, and precipitation  
- Visualized insights using Seaborn and Matplotlib

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**
